# Step 1: Read the CSV files
allstations_temp <- read_csv("allstations_temp.csv")
allstations_rain <- read_csv("allstations_rain.csv")

# Step 2: Extract station IDs from the temperature and rainfall data
temp_station_ids <- colnames(allstations_temp)[-1]  # Exclude the date column
rain_station_ids <- colnames(allstations_rain)[-1]  # Exclude the date column

# Step 3: Combine and summarize station IDs
all_station_ids <- unique(c(temp_station_ids, rain_station_ids))

# Step 4: Create a data frame for summary
station_summary <- data.frame(

# Step 5: Save the general summary information to a CSV file

# Step 6: Filter the summary to include only stations with both In_Temperature and In_Rainfall as TRUE
filtered_station_summary <- station_summary %>%

# Step 7: Save the filtered summary to a CSV file
write_csv(filtered_station_summary, "station_summary.csv")
